The June 10 case involved at least 13 criminal mischief incidents near the 1100 block of Crowley Road in Arlington. Grand jurors returned the indictments of graffiti causing $1,500 to $20,000 against John Austin Cartwright, 17, of Arlington; Daniel Damian Sibley, 18, of Fort Worth; Seth Stephen Hatcher, 18, of Arlington; and Morgen Rae Aubuchon, 18, of Arlington. The charge is a state jail felony. Trials are now pending for the four teens, according to Tarrant County criminal court records. A fifth teen, a 16-year-old girl, surrendered to authorities in late June and was turned over to Tarrant County juvenile authorities. She is not being identified because she is a juvenile. The status of the juvenile charges against her was unavailable on Monday. Home surveillance cameras caught the teens in the act, Arlington police have said.

The 17-year-old went to Terry's house on July 24th and grabbed her by the arm when she opened the door.
