The 17-year-old went to Terry's house on July 24th and grabbed her by the arm when she opened the door. Ayers, her two younger siblings, and several friends kicked and punched Terry while shouting homophobic slurs, leaving her with bruising, nausea and dizziness, according to the local paper.

The teen said that she went to Terry‚Äôs home in response to an altercation she had with Terry and Terry's partner, Lisa Lange, the day of incident. Ayers, however, entered a guilty plea Monday in an agreement that required prosecutors to drop a more serious first-degree burglary charge which carried a maximum 10-year prison sentence.
